the algorithm says the area covered by all the outer dots when joined together so that it gives the biggest area. first we have to join the wost extremest x,-x,y,-y points in the graph then after joing see for all the left over points in grpah outsid the drawn lines then we have to take the perpendicular lines to all the points and join them again with the main line straight the longest perpendicular line points should be sketched a straight line with the most extremest points that is x,-x,y,-y etc....
